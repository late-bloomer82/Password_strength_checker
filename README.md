# Password Strength Checker

## Project Description
A simple Python program that checks the strength of a user's password.

## Features
- Accepts password input securely (hidden while typing) using the `getpass` module.
- Checks password strength based on:
  - Minimum length(9)
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters

- Provides feedback to improve weak passwords.

# Project Lessons
- Hmmm, after doing this exercise, I realized it would have been better if I used a Class and made password an Object.
